Welcome to **Save Trees Sushi**!

In an effort to reduce waste and prevent order confusion, Team **Arkie Alderton** decided to create a digital sushi menu card that can be filled out through a web browser on a patron's smart phone, tablet or laptop.

Simply sit down and use a web browser to visit the URL provided at the table.

Add a quantity to a desired item and review the order in the summary bar.

When the order is submitted, the selected items, quantities and submition time are stored to a server database and then displayed on a dedicated Chef's page.

As the Chef completes an order, the items can checked off the list as complete and completion time stored to provide better time estimations and for chefs to review their performance and identify areas for improvement.

We hope you enjoyed you experience and look forward to seeing you again next time.

Thank you,

Team Arkie Alderton
